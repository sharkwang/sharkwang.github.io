<p>I live in Chengdu, a beautiful and modern city in the southwest of China. After learning the BASIC,a magic computer language, on an Apple II in 1984, when I was in primary school, from then on, coding has become a part of my life. I have worked as a sales engineer in BEA, then a manager in Oracle for many years. However, I found myself still love coding rather than any sales or manager things. Two years before,just after my 40th birthday, I decided to say goodbye to BIG companies. I want to turn back to the beginning, regain happiness from technology and software.</p>

<p>Now, I am working on 2 projects. </p>

<p>The first project is the <strong>Borgnix</strong>, an IOT design platform for beginners. It could help you to connect, manage and monitor the smart things, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, then combine them and create something interesting. The beta site has been online, you can visit <a href="https://dev.borgnix.com">https://dev.borgnix.com</a>.</p>

<p>The second one is <strong>Voyager</strong>, which is a fast data design toolset. You can trace any log generated by machines, parse it and create awesome algorithm to get analyze result interesting. The Voyager has been deployed in some banking big data system. This project will open source later.</p>
