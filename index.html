<p>I live in Chengdu, a beautiful city in the southwest of China. I am a coder, 42 years old. Since 1984 in primary school, I learned the BASIC on an Apple II, the coding is always be part of my life. When I was a young man, I worked for BEA, IBM and Oracle for many years. I worked as sales engineer, architect and manager. But finally, I found I still love coding. Two years before, when I was 40, I decided say goodbye to BIG companies. I want to turn back to the beginning, recover the happiness from technology and software.</p>
